# SOLID Prinicples Demo

## About

This project provides examples of the application of the **SOLID** principles.  The project is for educational purposes only and is meant to help the comprehension of **Object-Oriented Design and Analysis (OODA)** concepts.  The main auidence are upper division computer science students, but programming enthusiasts can leverage this project as well, however, it may require more tangental research if the audience is not familiar with basic programming concepts.

The examples are College-themed to be more relatable to the main audience and assumes that the audience is familar with Java/C#, basic data structures and introductory level programming concepts such as a "Constructor" and object instance.

## Directory Structure

* Each principle demonstration is broken up into their respective folder.  Each principle directory contains a _Before_ and an _After_ folder.  The _Before_ directory demonstates code in which the principle has not been applied, but has been updated to reflect requirements.  The _After_ directory demonstrates code in which the principle has been applied and requirements are satisfied.

* Each directory is meant to be self-containing and isolated.  As such, there are duplicate code files from one directory to the other, but the namespaces of the duplicate files have been updated to the proper directory.  This was done on purpose to reduce the need to navigate across multiple folder hierarchies and reduce file confusion.  It is **highly** recommened that this practice should **NOT** be followed other than in teaching scenarios.

## Important

* This code is **NOT** production-ready.

* Basic data structures and what-not were used **purposefuly** to reduce friction-points to learning the concepts.  Therefore, language-specific optimizations, such as automatic setters were not used.

* XML-Comments were not used to reduce "noise" while reading the code so that the audience can just focus on the concepts.

* Normal code comments are included to help improve comprehension for those that are new to .NET/C#.

* This project was updated to target .NET Standard 2.0 as of 1/1/2018.
