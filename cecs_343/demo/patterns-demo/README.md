# Design Patterns Demo

## About

This project showcases common design patterns.  Liberties were taken for each example in order to scaled down a pattern or alter it slightly in order to improve comprehension of the concept.  In addition, modifications were made so that the code is aligned within the .NET stack.  All patterns based off of the original Gang of Four (GoF) patterns described in _Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software_.
